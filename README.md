# Robo-Stuart
A digital replacement for our coworker while he's away on disability. 

## PreReqs
**Windows**
[PyWin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/) Is not available via pip and must be installed before using

It is **recommended** that you install [Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10121) so that you can get access to Microsoft Mike, as Anna is the only voice available by default on later Windows machines and let's face it, Stuart is no Anna.

Other requirements are specified in the requirements.txt and can be installed via pip

## Usage
Set up your prerequisites and requirements then simply
`python ramble.py` and go~

## Known Issues
Microsoft Mike is not being very compliant at the moment. So stick with Anna for now.
